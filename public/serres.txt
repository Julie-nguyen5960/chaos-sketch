No, we are not so exceptional; we are not the only ones endowed with
the capability to see, read or write: the wind traces its musical partition over
the waves of the sea and the dunes of the desert; running water weaves rich
branches of river-like arborescence; dust engraves cliffs that are already
sculpted or drawn by erosion; by their distinctive style, earthquakes, fractures,
hot spots, the low plate tectonics define the higher relief. The living leave
their remains, be it only bones. Magnetism marks itself and remains etched
on soft rock on its way to crystallization, indicating the time of its hardening;
radioactivity counts time; the climate leaves traces in dust buried in the deep
ice of the poles and the ice sheets; evolution deploys itself on organisms, more
disparate than systemic. We are not the only ones endowed with the capability
to count or remember; the trees calculate their years, crowned in their wood.
Nor are we the only ones endowed with the capability to code; everything
ultimately gets spelled out in the language of mathematics. I have already said
that we think like the world; now I am saying that the world thinks like us.
The world, so here it is.
